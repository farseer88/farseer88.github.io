Her mother, Maureen, is a retired nurse who had a small heart attack 5 years ago and a stroke 2 years ago. The stroke caused some weakness of her right limbs and the left side of her face to droop a little but she reached the hospital quickly and the doctors were able to treat it and break up the clot which caused the stroke. Despite the two events, Maureen continues to smoke and her diet consists of take-aways, microwave meals and lots of snack food. Her weight has increased a lot over the last 5 years. Nuala talks to her mother about her lifestyle and she agrees to try to give up smoking again. When it comes to her diet, Maureen doesn't know where to begin. She also says that if she gives up smoking she's going to feel hungrier. Nuala decides to cook her a few dinners a week to reintroduce her to healthy eating, hoping that it will encourage her mother to start cooking for herself. Nuala wonders how she is going to make the dinners filling enough but also within Maureen's energy needs.","transcriptLinkButton":"Transcript","transcriptLink":""},"_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true,"_isCompletionIndicatorEnabled":true}},{"_id":"c-20-10-1","_parentId":"b-20-10","_type":"component","_component":"text","_classes":"","_layout":"left","title":"Calories and Joules","displayTitle":"","body":"In nutrition, the energy that food contains is measured in <b>calories</b> or <b>Joules</b>.

However, Terry's recovery is not complete, he still has some weakness in his right arm and leg and some vision issues.

On returning home, Terry is now unable to drive and Dave decides to stay with his father to help with his rehabilitation and diet.
