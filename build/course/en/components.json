One afternoon when working on his farm, he begins to feel unwell and his vision becomes a little blurry. He falls and realises that his left side feels unusual. Luckily, he is able to reach his phone and dial 112. An ambulance arrives and takes him to hospital. During the journey and after he arrives at the hospital he begins to feel a little better and his vision improves. The doctors ask him lots of questions, examine him and do blood tests and a brain scan. He is diagnosed with a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or 'mini-stroke' and makes a complete recovery. While in hopsital the doctors start him on some new medications and he also meets with the dietician who tells him lots of information about what foods he should and shouldn't eat. After returning home, George feels overwhelmed. He really doesn't want to have another stroke. It all sounded manageable when he was in hospital but now he doesn't know how to make the right changes to his diet and lifestyle.","transcriptLinkButton":"Transcript","transcriptLink":""},"_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true,"_isCompletionIndicatorEnabled":true}},{"_id":"c-10-30-1","_parentId":"b-10-30","_type":"component","_component":"hotgraphic","_classes":"","_layout":"left","_comment":"setCompletionOn = inview | allItems","_setCompletionOn":"allItems","_canCycleThroughPagination":false,"_hidePagination":false,"_isNarrativeOnMobile":false,"_useNumberedPins":false,"_useGraphicsAsPins":false,"title":"","displayTitle":"","body":"","instruction":"","_graphic":{"src":"course/en/images/b-10-30-nutrients.jpg","alt":""},"_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":false,"_isCompletionIndicatorEnabled":false}},{"_id":"c-10-30-2","_parentId":"b-10-30","_type":"component","_component":"text","_classes":"","_layout":"right","title":"Nutrients","displayTitle":"","body":"Nutrients are substances obtained from food and used in the body to provide energy and materials for growth, maintenance, and repair of the body's tissues.<br><br>Carbohydrates, fats and proteins are the energy-containing nutrients and are sometimes called <b>macro</b>nutrients.<br><br>They provide the energy we need (often represented as calories) for many of our bodily functions.<br><br>Vitamins, minerals and water are the <b>micro</b>nutrients and they do not provide energy.

Her mother, Maureen, is a retired nurse who had a small heart attack 5 years ago and a stroke 2 years ago. The stroke caused some weakness of her right limbs and the left side of her face to droop a little but she reached the hospital quickly and the doctors were able to treat it and break up the clot which caused the stroke. Despite the two events, Maureen continues to smoke and her diet consists of take-aways, microwave meals and lots of snack food. Her weight has increased a lot over the last 5 years. Nuala talks to her mother about her lifestyle and she agrees to try to give up smoking again. When it comes to her diet, Maureen doesn't know where to begin. She also says that if she gives up smoking she's going to feel hungrier. Nuala decides to cook her a few dinners a week to reintroduce her to healthy eating, hoping that it will encourage her mother to start cooking for herself. Nuala wonders how she is going to make the dinners filling enough but also within Maureen's energy needs.","transcriptLinkButton":"Transcript","transcriptLink":""},"_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true,"_isCompletionIndicatorEnabled":true}},{"_id":"c-20-10-1","_parentId":"b-20-10","_type":"component","_component":"text","_classes":"Calories and Joules","_layout":"left","title":"","displayTitle":"","body":"In nutrition, the energy that food contains is measured in <b>calories</b> or <b>Joules</b>.

She is down as his emergency contact but she can't get away from work so Dave goes to the hospital. While talking to the doctor, he discovers that his father has had a stroke. Terry is started on new medications and stays in hospital for a few weeks for rehabilitation. Initially he has some problems swallowing but this improves. However, Terry's recovery is not complete, he still has some weakness in his right arm and leg and some vision issues. Dave is present during some, but not all of the conversations that his father has with the doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and dietician. On returning home, Terry is now unable to drive and Dave decides to stay with his father to help with his rehabilitation and diet. Their budget is limited but the dietician said that his father's diet is really important if he wants to prevent another stroke.","transcriptLinkButton":"Transcript","transcriptLink":""},"_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true,"_isCompletionIndicatorEnabled":true}},{"_id":"c-40-10-1","_parentId":"b-40-10","_type":"component","_component":"text","_classes":"","_layout":"left","title":"","displayTitle":"","body":"After completing this lesson, you will be able to:<ul><li>Describe some of the barriers that prevent people from changing their diet.</li><li>Work out the calories and macronutrients in any recipe.</li><li>Find recipes online, compare them to your own requirements and alter them as necessary.</li><li>Create a meal plan for a week that meets your energy and nutrient requirements.</li><li>Create a shopping list for your groceries.</li></ul>","instruction":"","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true,"_isCompletionIndicatorEnabled":false}},{"_id":"c-40-10-2","_parentId":"b-40-10","_type":"component","_component":"hotgraphic","_classes":"","_layout":"right","_comment":"setCompletionOn = inview | allItems","_setCompletionOn":"allItems","_canCycleThroughPagination":false,"_hidePagination":false,"_isNarrativeOnMobile":false,"_useNumberedPins":false,"_useGraphicsAsPins":false,"title":"","displayTitle":"","body":"","instruction":"","_graphic":{"src":"course/en/images/b-10-20-LOs.jpg","alt":""},"_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true,"_isCompletionIndicatorEnabled":false}},{"_id":"c-40-15-1","_parentId":"b-40-15","_type":"component","_component":"hotgraphic","_classes":"","_layout":"left","_comment":"setCompletionOn = inview | allItems","_setCompletionOn":"allItems","_canCycleThroughPagination":false,"_hidePagination":false,"_isNarrativeOnMobile":false,"_useNumberedPins":false,"_useGraphicsAsPins":false,"title":"","displayTitle":"","body":"","instruction":"","_graphic":{"src":"course/en/images/b-40-15-barrier.jpg","alt":""},"_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true,"_isCompletionIndicatorEnabled":false}},{"_id":"c-40-15-2","_parentId":"b-40-15","_type":"component","_component":"text","_classes":"","_layout":"right","title":"","displayTitle":"","body":"Dietary habits are difficult to change and meal planning is a very important tool that can help you start and maintain a healthy diet.<br><br>There are a number of barriers when anyone tries to change their diet:<ul><li>We tend to eat what is put in front of us, even if it causes us to feel over-full.</li><li>We tend to overestimate how much food we need to feel full.</li><li>We think we don't have enough time to cook or meal plan.</li><li>We become overwhelmed by how much there is to know about nutrition and diets.</li><li>We receive conflicting advice about what diets are best and what we need to do to lose weight.</li></ul>","instruction":"","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true,"_isCompletionIndicatorEnabled":false}},{"_id":"c-40-20-1","_parentId":"b-40-20","_type":"component","_component":"text","_classes":"","_layout":"left","title":"","displayTitle":"","body":"Meal planning is a very important part of starting a new diet.
