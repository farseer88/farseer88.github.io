One afternoon when working on his farm, he begins to feel unwell and his vision becomes a little blurry. He falls and realises that his left side feels unusual. Luckily, he is able to reach his phone and dial 112. An ambulance arrives and takes him to hospital. During the journey and after he arrives at the hospital he begins to feel a little better and his vision improves. The doctors ask him lots of questions, examine him and do blood tests and a brain scan. He is diagnosed with a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or 'mini-stroke' and makes a complete recovery. While in hopsital the doctors start him on some new medications and he also meets with the dietician who tells him lots of information about what foods he should and shouldn't eat. After returning home, George feels overwhelmed. He really doesn't want to have another stroke. It all sounded manageable when he was in hospital but now he doesn't know how to make the right changes to his diet and lifestyle.","transcriptLinkButton":"Transcript","transcriptLink":""},"_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true,"_isCompletionIndicatorEnabled":true}},{"_id":"c-10-30-1","_parentId":"b-10-30","_type":"component","_component":"graphic","_classes":"","_layout":"left","title":"","displayTitle":"","body":"","instruction":"","_graphic":{"src":"course/en/images/b-10-30-nutrients.jpg","alt":"","attribution":""},"_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":false,"_isCompletionIndicatorEnabled":false}},{"_id":"c-10-30-2","_parentId":"b-10-30","_type":"component","_component":"text","_classes":"","_layout":"right","title":"Nutrients","displayTitle":"","body":"Nutrients are substances obtained from food and used in the body to provide energy and materials for growth, maintenance, and repair of the body's tissues.<br><br>Carbohydrates, fats and proteins are the energy-containing nutrients.<br><br>They provide the energy we need (often represented as calories) for many of our bodily functions.<br><br>Vitamins, minerals and water are the other nutrients and they do not provide energy.
