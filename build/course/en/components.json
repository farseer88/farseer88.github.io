The stroke caused some weakness of her right limbs and the left side of her face to droop a little but she reached the hospital quickly and the doctors were able to treat it and break up the clot which caused the stroke. Despite the two events, Maureen continues to smoke and her diet consists of take-aways, microwave meals and lots of snack food. Her weight has increased a lot over the last 5 years. Nuala talks to her mother about her lifestyle and she agrees to try to give up smoking again. When it comes to her diet, Maureen doesn't know where to begin. She also says that if she gives up smoking she's going to feel hungrier. Nuala decides to cook her a few dinners a week to reintroduce her to healthy eating, hoping that it will encourage her mother to start cooking for herself.

However, Terry's recovery is not complete, he still has some weakness in his right arm and leg and some vision issues.

Creating a shopping list is really important for a number of reasons:<ol><li>It makes shopping much less stressful as it requires less thinking.</li><li>It helps to prevent buying unhealthy foods.</li><li>By grouping similar items together it allows you to get your shopping done efficiently. This also helps when an ingredient is unavilable, you're already in the area where you will find similar ingredients that you can substitute in.</li><li>It helps with budgeting as you are much less likely to buy extra 'just in case'.</li>","instruction":"","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true,"_isCompletionIndicatorEnabled":false}},{"_id":"c-40-75-1","_parentId":"b-40-75","_type":"component","_component":"text","_classes":"","_layout":"left","title":"Important Kitchen Tools","displayTitle":"","body":"There are some kitchen tools that many home cooks do without.

Preparing ingredients will include things like peeling and cutting vegetables, slicing and removing fat and skin from meat and soaking or rinsing grains and legumes.<br><br>This may take slightly longer the first time you prepare the meal but will make the experience far more enjoyable and will allow you more time to taste the food as you go along and add more seasoning if necessary.<br><br>Then, the next time, you'll be more aware of how much time you have between steps of the recipe and be able to judge what you should prepare before and what you can prepare as you are cooking.<br><br>Sometimes recipes give an estimate of how long it takes to prepare ingredients.
